# Distance-Measurement-System-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-Atmega
This project involves designing a distance measurement system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and an ATmega32 microcontroller running at 8 MHz. The system measures distance and displays the value on a 4x16 LCD. Key components include GPIO, ICU, and LCD drivers, with the ultrasonic sensor providing accurate distance readings.
