# Distance-Measurement-System-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-Atmega
This project involves designing a distance measurement system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and an ATmega32 microcontroller running at 8 MHz. The system measures distance and displays the value on a 4x16 LCD. Key components include GPIO, ICU, and LCD drivers, with the ultrasonic sensor providing accurate distance readings.

Overview
This project involves designing a distance measurement system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor interfaced with an ATmega16 microcontroller running at 8 MHz. The measured distance is displayed on an LCD.

System Requirements
Microcontroller: ATmega16 running at 8 MHz.
Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04 for distance measurement.
LCD Display: 4x16 LCD to display the distance value.
Architecture: The project is designed using a layered architecture model.
Implementation Details
GPIO Driver
Usage: Use the same GPIO driver implemented in the course.
ICU (Input Capture Unit) Driver
Usage: Use the same ICU driver implemented in the course.
Configuration:
Frequency: F_CPU/8
First edge detection: Rising edge
Initialization and Callbacks:
ICU_init and ICU_setCallBack functions should be called inside the Ultrasonic_init function.
LCD Driver
LCD Type: 4x16 LCD.
Mode: 8-bits data mode.
Connections:
RS → PB0
RW → PB1
E → PB2
Data Bus → all PORTA pins
Ultrasonic Driver
Driver Implementation: Implement a full ultrasonic driver using the ATmega16 ICU driver.
Functions:
void Ultrasonic_init(void): Initializes the ICU driver and sets up the trigger pin.
void Ultrasonic_Trigger(void): Sends the trigger pulse to the ultrasonic sensor.
uint16 Ultrasonic_readDistance(void): Sends the trigger pulse and starts the measurement.
void Ultrasonic_edgeProcessing(void): Callback function to calculate the high time (pulse time) generated by the ultrasonic sensor.
